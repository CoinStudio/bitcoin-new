# Bitcoin New

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bitcoin-new/bitcoin-new.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bitcoin-new/bitcoin-new)

Bitcoin New (codename bitcoin-new) is a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain that will occur at block height 501000, at roughly Around 12/25/2017 @ 3:23pm (UTC).

At the predetermined block height, Bitcoin New miners will begin creating blocks with a new proof-of-work algorithm, and this will cause a bifurcation of the Bitcoin blockchain. The original Bitcoin blockchain will continue on unaltered, but a new branch of the blockchain will split off from the original chain. The new branch is a distinct blockchain with the same transaction history as Bitcoin up until the fork, but then diverges from it. As a result of this process, a new cryptocurrency will be born.
